**Hello , My name is Mu'ath Shabatat and I want to talk to you about growth mindset**
  
  
*A growth mindset is thebelieve and the trust that our abilities can be developed and improved through any thing hard.without  growth mindset we don't exert the required effort which help us to success and remain stuck.with a growth mindset, we can break through the stuck-ness and achieve the results we desire*.

 


***Things don't forget***

- *Don't say~~I can't~~,always you can.*
- *Keep try in any way and don't give up.*
- *The failure is the road to success.*
